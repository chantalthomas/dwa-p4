## Notes for instructor
+ I am ran into some issues with using a calendar package early and tried resolving those issues for far too long unfortunately. sI definitely bit off more than I could chew at my currently skill level! But once grades are in I plan to tackle getting the  MaddHatter LaravelFullcalendar psckage fully embedded in my application so that the user events appear on a calendar instead of in a list.
